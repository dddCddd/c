* Many fails can on Jigsaw? I google that and can be explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables) 
* Also [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52930543/8-digit-hex-is-not-a-background-color-value/52931314#52931314) The Jigsaw W3C CSS validator isn't known for being up to date with developing standards, such as most level 4 CSS features. New features are being introduced and implemented faster than they can be standardized or validators can catch up, so validation has become increasingly unreliable as anything other than a sanity check for potential careless mistakes, rather than traditional standards-compliance "certification" (if you will).
As long as you use the notation with the understanding that browser support isn't complete and these drafts are subject to change (although support for this notation is extremely unlikely to change), you'll be fine.
If you are concerned about validation, your best bet is to rewrite these values to their rgba() counterparts, which enjoy cross-browser support and are recognized by Jigsaw.
